To use:
1. Download files
2. Install dependencies
3. run main.py

- lock nodes into place
- box select nodes
- auto generate nodes for a topic with AI
- auto generate nodes for YouTube video highlights and other media
- allow multiple connection schemes for a set of nodesand switch between them
- ...
