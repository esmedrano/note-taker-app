1. Download and unzip file 
2. Open comand line and install dependencies- all the ones you need are imported at the top of main.py

- box select nodes
- auto generate nodes for a topic with AI
- auto generate nodes for YouTube video highlights and other media
- allow multiple connection schemes for a set of nodes and switch between them
- ...
