pygame is just so easy to use... right?

My main concern is that the code may become too slow to use. 
See overclock() in notes.py

Otherwise I'd like to improve upon Obsidian:
- lock nodes into place
- box select nodes
- auto generate nodes for a topic with AI
- auto generate nodes for YouTube video highlights and other media
- allow multiple connection schemes for a set of nodesand switch between them
- ...
