pygame is just so easy to use... right?

My main concern is that the code may become too slow to use. 
I'm not so worried anymore because I optimized when the screen redraws take place. Now it only redraws when something changes. It would be cool to figure out how to only redraw the changes.

I'd like to improve upon Obsidian:
- lock nodes into place
- box select nodes
- auto generate nodes for a topic with AI
- auto generate nodes for YouTube video highlights and other media
- allow multiple connection schemes for a set of nodes and switch between them
- ...
